# Analytica

Analytica is a Twitch Extension that allows the broadcaster to set up a leaderboard for viewers.

This leaderboard has categories of:
- total time watched
- total chat messages
- total subs(gifted and personal)
- cheers

This project was created at the Twitchcon 2019 Hackathon using React.js and the Twitch dev rig.
